This course is for summer undergraduates performing research in astrophysics at University of Toronto.  The goal is to provide training to help students be successful with the computation aspects of their summer research program.

===Logistics===
The course will run every afternoon from '''1:00pm to 5:00pm''', from '''Tuesday May 8''' to '''Friday May 18'''.
This 4-hour block will be split into two hours of lecture followed by two hours of tutorial time, in which students will work on their course homework.

Location: '''MP 257''' -- computer lab on the second floor of the McLennan annex.

===Marking Scheme===
The mark will be determined on the basis of three items:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|1. Class participation:
|10%
|-
|2. Homework: 
|30%
|-
|3. Project:
| 60%
|-
|}

===Homeworks===
In the first week students will work on a homework problem set related to the first week's lectures.  For the second week they will work on a week-long project that will be closely related to the research they do for the rest of the summer.  They will hand in their results for this project at the end of the course.

The first problem set can be found [[here|https://github.com/ttricco/cta200h/blob/master/problemset1/problemset1.pdf]]
