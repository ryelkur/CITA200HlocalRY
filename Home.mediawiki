Welcome to the CTA200H wiki!

This course is for summer undergraduates performing research in astrophysics at University of Toronto, including but not limited to participants in UoT's Summer Undergraduate Research Program (or SURP). The goal is to provide training to help students be successful with the computation aspects of their summer research program.

===Logistics===
The course will run every afternoon from '''1:00pm to 5:00pm''', from '''Tuesday May 3''' to '''Friday May 13'''.
This 4-hour block will be split into two hours of lecture followed by two hours of tutorial time, in which students will work on their course homework.

Location: The course will be held both in person and remotely, via zoom, with access to CITA computers via ssh/tunnel, or via VNC Remote Desktop

===Marking Scheme===
The mark will be determined on the basis of three items:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|1. Class participation:
|10%
|-
|2. Homework: 
|40%
|-
|3. Project:
|50%
|-
|}

===Homeworks===
In the first week students will work on homework problems related to the first week's lectures.  For the second week they will work on a week-long project that will be closely related to the research they do for the rest of the summer.  They will hand in their results for this project at the end of the course.

The problem set will be divided into smaller assignments to be handed in every couple of days. Assignments will be posted here once announced.

===Project===
In the second week students will work on a project supplied either by their supervisor or the instructor. The project is due by midnight, Friday May 14th
