# Scientific computing workflow in Linux

This session aims to get students up to speed with working under Linux environment as quickly as possible. After a brief walkthrough of essential commands, we will perform a few tasks as prescribed in emails from a fictional research supervisor Chris T.A. (CTA). Important concepts and essential tools will be introduced on the way. The introduction will be neither deep nor exhaustive, but should enable students to learn more on their own.
